[mod-setting-description]
tick-rate=How often signal networks should be updated. Lower is both faster and more CPU-intensive.
scan-rate=How often signal networks should be calculated. Lower is both faster and more CPU-intensive.
satellite-channels=How many channels each satellite in a satellite-based signal network can carry. The total number of allowable channels is this value multiplied by the number of launched communications satellites.
